## Learning C
This repo is a collection of assignments and mini-programs/projects for beginners trying to learn C.

Try to complete each task without looking at the solution!

>[!NOTE]
> - Solutions have been deleted from the main branch!  This is so that anyone who forks can make an attempt to complete each without being tempted to refer to solutions posted by others.  You can still find the solutions on other branches of the repository
> - This repository is still a work-in-progress, but totally usable in its current state.  At any rate, expect consistent, incremental improvements in the coming days.
